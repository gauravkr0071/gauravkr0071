âš¡ Latest Updates : Glad to inform you that my paper on "__Fault diagnosis of Machines using Deep Convolutional Beta-Variational Autoencoder__" has been accepted by __IEEE Transactions on Artificial intelligence__ on 4th sept 2021. It will take some time for IEEE team to publish on ieee sites. Codes and tutorial of this paper will be uploaded [here](https://github.com/gauravkr0071/beta-VAE) soon.   

### __A little about me__

My Research interests revolves around Computer vision, Image segmentation ,Probabilistic graphical model, Deep Generative model, Bayesian Network, Condition based monitoring of electrical system or any physical system and Brain-Computer interface domain to understand the effects in brain during various activities(emotions).

Currently, i am trying to blend manual Statistical method into Deep Generative Model for generating new data of similar domain but novel from available data which gives flexibility in controlling the generated data as opposite to present state of the art techniques.

In my free time i like to do leetcoding, wasting time learning new algos and day dreaming about the work going on DeepMind.

My life long dream is to give machines a sense of conciousness. Wait, do we understand conciousness enough ?. well thats, debatable

Want to collaborate with me on something ? drop me a mail
